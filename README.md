# Sudoku Solver

This is a simple sudoku solver written in Java. It will have a basic GUI for generating a puzzle to solve, solving the current puzzle, or loading in your own puzzle from a file.

Presently, the algorithm for solving the puzzle is a straight-forward, brute-force implementation of depth-first search. Once the GUI is working like it's supposed to, I plan to read more about and try to implement the Dancing Links algorithm, which I suspect will be much more efficient.
